# üîê Anonymous Social Network: Security Guide

This guide outlines best practices for securing an anonymous social network that supports messaging, media sharing, and user interactions.

---

## üîí Core Security Principles

### 1. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) for Chats

- Use protocols like **Signal Protocol** or the **Double Ratchet Algorithm**.
- Each user generates a **key pair locally**.
- Register only the **public key** with the server.
- Messages are encrypted with the recipient's public key and decrypted locally using the private key.

**Recommended Libraries:**
- `libsignal` (Signal)
- `OMEMO` (for XMPP)
- `libsodium` / `NaCl`

---

### 2. Anonymous User Identity

Avoid persistent identifiers. Options include:
- Random **UUIDs** or **ephemeral handles**
- **Ephemeral key pairs** for session identity

**Anti-spam Tools:**
- Anonymous **CAPTCHAs** (e.g., hCaptcha)
- **Rate limiting**
- **Proof-of-work** challenges

---

### 3. Secure Media Handling

Media sharing needs extra care:
- Encrypt files **client-side** before upload (e.g., AES-256)
- Store in secure locations (e.g., **S3**, private object storage)
- Access via **signed URLs**
- Share **media decryption keys** through E2EE chat

---

### 4. Secure Connections Between Users

Enable chat between anonymous users by:
- Exchanging **public identity keys**
- Sharing via:
    - **QR codes**
    - **Invite links**
    - **Session codes**

Use:
- **Secure relay servers** (e.g., WebSocket)
- **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer connections with TURN/STUN

---

### 5. Transport Layer Security

- All connections should be over **HTTPS (TLS 1.3)**
- Implement **certificate pinning** on clients

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Abuse Prevention

Even anonymous platforms need moderation:

- **Rate limits** and **request throttling**
- **Anonymous reputation scores**
- **Machine learning-based content moderation**
- **Community reporting**
- **Temporary or soft bans**

## ‚úÖ Workflow Overview

1. **User joins anonymously**
    - Client generates key pair
    - Registers public key with server

2. **User initiates chat**
    - Obtains recipient‚Äôs public key (QR/link/etc.)
    - Starts E2EE communication via relay/WebRTC

3. **User sends media**
    - Client encrypts file
    - Uploads to server/CDN
    - Shares decryption key via chat

---

## üìå Notes

- All private data stays encrypted client-side.
- Server stores only public metadata and relays encrypted content.
- Consider using ephemeral accounts to enhance privacy.
