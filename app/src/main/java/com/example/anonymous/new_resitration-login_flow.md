### âœ… Security Strengths

- Generate the keypair on the client â†’ the private key never leaves the device.
- The server stores only the public key and UUID â†’ no sensitive material is exposed.
- Use a challengeâ€“response mechanism â†’ prevents replay attacks.
- Issue a JWT only after verifying the signature â†’ ensures the client holds the private key.
- The QR code contains a signed JWT (not raw data) â†’ tamper-proof and verifiable.

### ðŸ”’ Additional Security Tips

- Use short-lived JWTs in the QR code (e.g. 5â€“15 minutes).
- Store and expire nonces after one use.
- Rate-limit login attempts per UUID/IP.
- Consider rotating JWT signing keys periodically.

## ðŸ§© Flow

### Registration

- Server generates UUID
- Client generates keypair
- Client sends { uuid, publicKey } to server
- Server stores user and returns a JWT:
    - Payload: { uuid, publicKey }
    - Expiry: short (e.g. 15 min)
- Client embeds this JWT in a QR code

### Login

1. Client scans QR â†’ extracts JWT
2. Client sends JWT to server â†’ server verifies and returns a nonce
3. Client signs nonce with privateKey â†’ sends signature
4. Server verifies signature â†’ issues session JWT (longer expiry)
5. Client stores session JWT and uses it in Authorization header
